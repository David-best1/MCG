Multi Console Game

Hello, my friend ðŸ˜Š

Here i'd like to tell you how to play! ðŸ¤©

You need to open folder "Multi-Console Game"
    and if you want to play on server open .exe - Client,
    if you want to start your own server open .exe - Server

or if you want check saved files of servers you had played or created open folder - Saved_data

I'd like to end here, but I don't know how, since this is my first public project
